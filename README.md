So, you decided you want to get into the world of retro gaming, don’t you? I made a guide to retro gaming so that you can find what’s best for you. can try to help you make a gaming collection you can easily and safely make out of.



To begin with, never buy a fake copy of the game because it will not work in a way or even harm your console. According to DKoldies, “buying them financially supports the criminal enterprises that make them”. So it’s important to tell what and what’s not a counterfeit in resources such as my list in order to not get scammed by these malicious people.

DKoldies is one of the best gaming stores to get from. They can have great bargains for games such as having up to 34% off Nintendo Switch games. Although, a downside is that sometimes prices in DKoldies can be high, so check other sites like Ebay to see whether or not you choose to buy it from them. They only have authentic games though, so there is no need to check for counterfeits.



Ebay is a wholesome source for retro games and consoles. There are over thousands of listings to choose from. Make sure the seller is well trusted as well as check the seller’s review history. Great sellers have more than %99 in reviews as well as little to no negative reviews. Though, check for counterfeits to make sure you’re getting the right thing.



        Thrift Stores like Goodwill probably have the items you need in their following stores. Goodwill and some thrift stores can have auctions and listings, so know what to do before you buy the things you want for your collection. You can also go to your nearest retro video game store and buy things from there. It will not have every game, so you can also do the two options above.



Another way to get games is by your local garage sales or flea markets. Just go to the different stalls and try to find what you're looking for. Beware of counterfeits the fact that the seller is probably unknown and you don’t really know and trust these sellers because of it. If you can’t find what you are looking for, go somewhere else to find your games and/or consoles.


To wrap up, the best places to find video games is at DKoldies or Ebay. If you want to go somewhere else or get games in person, thrift stores, garage sales, or flea markets are a go for you. I can’t wait to see what you racked up!
